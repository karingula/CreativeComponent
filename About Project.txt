PROJECT TITLE:  This project is all about Loading complex and large data sets into Database.
Note: project could also be amplified on a large scale which is helpful for
      -> research work especially in the fields of agriculture, genetics, Bio-informatics, etc.
      -> Maintaining bulk amounts of real time generated data from aeroplanes during its journey of flight
      -> Data wrangling in production units, factories, rail/road systems, electricity power plants, etc.
      

steps performed:-

1. write code to extract the data sets into text files
2. Design the schema for Database tables
3. Write code to implement the database schema like creating tables, imposing constraints in those tables
4. wite code to load data into created database tables

Data used in this project: For sample, the data sets of a Super-store-sales is used to demonstrate the project.

Type of data used: The data set used for demonstration is pretty complex involving all data types, special characters,
                   European characters,etc.
